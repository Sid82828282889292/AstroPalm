            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Palmistry, also known as chiromancy, is the practice of telling fortunes from the lines, marks, and patterns on the hands, particularly the palms. It has roots in ancient Indian astrology and was later adopted by the Chinese, Tibetans, Persians, Egyptians, and Greeks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Throughout history, palmistry has been both celebrated as a window into human character and destiny, and dismissed as mere superstition. Today, it continues to fascinate as both a cultural tradition and a tool for self-reflection.
