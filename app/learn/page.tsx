const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is palmistry scientific?",
    answer: "Palmistry is considered an esoteric art rather than a science. While it lacks scientific validation, many practitioners find value in its insights and symbolic representations of character and life patterns."
  },
  {
    question: "Which hand should be read?",
    answer: "Traditionally, the non-dominant hand is read to understand inherent traits and potential, while the dominant hand reveals how you've developed these traits through life experience."
  },
  {
    question: "Can palm lines change?",
    answer: "Yes, palm lines can change subtly over time. Major life events, shifts in attitude, and significant personal growth can influence the depth, clarity, and even the path of certain lines."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a short life line mean a short life?",
    answer: "No. Contrary to popular belief, the life line doesn't primarily indicate longevity. It reveals vitality, energy, and major life changes rather than the length of one's life."
